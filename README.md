# Auto-Encoders
  Auto-encoders are a powerful tool for latent representation of the images. An autoencoder model can be trained to denoise images, create high-resolution images,
for image compression and even for new image data generation. There are many approaches to leveraging the benefits of an auto-encoding network, some of the renowned are
through CNN networks or dense networks. 

Here in this repository different approaches to auto-encoding networks will be shared.  

## Create Virtual Environment For Linux Based Systems (Google Colab Notebooks)

`!virtualenv {envname}`
### To activate a virtual env 
`!source path-to-venv/bin/activate;`


## Create Virtual Environment For Windows Based Systems 
`python3 -m venv {name}`

### To activate a virtual env
`\path-to-venv\Scripts\activate`

## To install the packages
`pip install requirements.txt`

## To install a specific package
`pip install {package name}`

## To install a specific version of the package
`pip install {package name} == {version no}`
