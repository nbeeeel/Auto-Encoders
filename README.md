# Auto-Encoders
  Auto-encoders are a powerful tool for latent representation of the images. An autoencoder model can be trained to denoise images, create high-resolution images,
for image compression and even for new image data generation. There are many approaches to leveraging the benefits of an auto-encoding network, some of the renowned are
through CNN networks or dense networks. 

Here in this repository different approaches to auto-encoding networks will be shared.
